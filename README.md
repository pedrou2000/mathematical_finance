# Mathematical Finance, Open Markets and Hybrid Jacobi Model
This is the repository for my Mathematics Bachelor's thesis, which focuses on mathematical finance, specifically exploring open market investment frameworks 
where investments are limited to the top N stocks. Building upon my supervisor's Hybrid Jacobi Model, the project investigates the optimal trading 
strategy for a pure open market under the Hybrid Jacobi model's assumptions. Divided into two phases, the first involves a comprehensive theoretical 
study of the investment framework and the Hybrid Jacobi Model's application to the pure open market. The ongoing second phase entails testing the 
derived trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance and potential practical implications.
